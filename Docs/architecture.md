# SANd Architecture

## Overview
The SANd protocol is designed to provide secure point-to-point communication with features like zero trust authentication, end-to-end encryption, and dynamic segmentation.

## Components
- **Protocol Core:** Manages handshake, encryption, and decryption.
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer:** Interfaces with isooptic and spintronic devices.
- **BusyBox Integration:** Provides a lightweight interface for resource-constrained routers.

# sLAN: Secure Local Area Network

sLAN is a lightweight, secure LAN solution designed for high-speed, low-latency local network environments. Building on the ideas from SANd, sLAN focuses on efficient point-to-point communication within a controlled LAN environment while leveraging modern encryption and dynamic segmentation.

## Features
- **Optimized for LAN:** Minimal latency and high throughput for local network communications.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Ensures secure message exchange within the local area.
- **Dynamic Segmentation:** Allows for flexible local network segmentation and policy enforcement.
- **BusyBox Compatibility:** Lightweight integration to work with embedded systems or BusyBox routers.
- **Robust Error Checking:** Built-in error handling to ensure secure and reliable operations.
