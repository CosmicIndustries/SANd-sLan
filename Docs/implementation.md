# Implementation Details

## Security Model
- **Handshake:** Secure key exchange to establish a zero-trust environment.
- **Encryption:** Using symmetric encryption (Fernet) for demo purposes.
- **Segmentation:** Dynamic tagging to segment network traffic.

## Integration with BusyBox
- The protocol is designed with a small footprint and leverages standard Unix sockets.
- Placeholder functions allow for easy integration with BusyBox utilities.

## Error Checking
- Comprehensive error handling is embedded at each communication step.
- Fallback mechanisms ensure that network integrity is maintained.

# sLAN Architecture

## Overview
sLAN is a secure LAN protocol that emphasizes high performance and low latency for local communications. It achieves security through robust encryption, dynamic segmentation, and continuous error monitoring.

## Components
- **Protocol Core:**  
  Handles secure handshake, encryption/decryption, and message routing.
- **Dynamic Segmentation Engine:**  
  Enables flexible grouping of LAN nodes to enforce local security policies.
- **BusyBox Integration:**  
  Lightweight components to support embedded or resource-constrained environments.
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (Optional):**  
  Provides hooks for interfacing with specialized hardware if available.
