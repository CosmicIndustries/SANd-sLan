# SANd-sLan
SANd is a prototype implementation of a new secure point-to-point networking paradigm designed for instantaneous, secure, and error-proof communication. It is built to integrate with resource-constrained BusyBox routers while leveraging modern hardware such as Quantum, IsoOptic and Spintronic systems.
