# SANd: Secure Area Network Datagram/base
SANd is a prototype implementation of a new secure point-to-point networking paradigm designed for instantaneous, secure, and error-proof communication. It is built to integrate with resource-constrained BusyBox routers while leveraging modern hardware such as Quantum, IsoOptic and Spintronic systems.
## Features
- **Zero Trust Authentication:** Secure handshake for every connection.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Protects data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Dynamic Segmentation:** Real-time network segmentation.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Lightweight integration with BusyBox environments.
- **Hardware Abstraction:** Interfaces for isooptic and spintronic hardware.
- **Comprehensive Error Checking:** Robust fault detection and recovery.

## Repository Structure
- **docs/**: Architecture and implementation documentation.
- **src/**: Source code for the SANd protocol and BusyBox integration.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for the protocol functions.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SANd.git
Install the required dependencies:

	pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the prototype:

		python src/sand.py

# sLAN: Secure Local Area Network

sLAN is a lightweight, secure LAN solution designed for high-speed, low-latency local network environments. Building on the ideas from SANd, sLAN focuses on efficient point-to-point communication within a controlled LAN environment while leveraging modern encryption and dynamic segmentation.

## Features
- **Optimized for LAN:** Minimal latency and high throughput for local network communications.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Ensures secure message exchange within the local area.
- **Dynamic Segmentation:** Allows for flexible local network segmentation and policy enforcement.
- **BusyBox Compatibility:** Lightweight integration to work with embedded systems or BusyBox routers.
- **Robust Error Checking:** Built-in error handling to ensure secure and reliable operations.

## Repository Structure
- **docs/**: Architecture and implementation documentation.
- **src/**: Source code for sLAN protocol and BusyBox integration.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for verifying protocol functionality.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sLAN.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   
		pip install -r requirements.txt
  
4. Run the sLAN prototype:
   
		python src/slan.py
