# SANd-sLan---
# SANd: Secure Area Network Datagram/base
SANd is a prototype implementation of a new secure point-to-point networking paradigm designed for instantaneous, secure, and error-proof communication. It is built to integrate with resource-constrained BusyBox routers while leveraging modern hardware such as Quantum, IsoOptic and Spintronic systems.

# sLAN: Secure Local Area Network

sLAN is a lightweight, secure LAN solution designed for high-speed, low-latency local network environments. Building on the ideas from SANd, sLAN focuses on efficient point-to-point communication within a controlled LAN environment while leveraging modern encryption and dynamic segmentation.

## Features
- **Optimized for LAN:** Minimal latency and high throughput for local network communications.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Ensures secure message exchange within the local area.
- **Dynamic Segmentation:** Allows for flexible local network segmentation and policy enforcement.
- **BusyBox Compatibility:** Lightweight integration to work with embedded systems or BusyBox routers.
- **Robust Error Checking:** Built-in error handling to ensure secure and reliable operations.

## Repository Structure
